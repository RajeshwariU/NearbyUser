###### How to use

1.Create object for mapManagers class[which is in pod] <br />  
Example: <br />
var mapObject = mapManagers() 

2.mapManagers class has below method with returntype of GMSMapView<br />
public func initLocationManagerWithRadiusAndMap(getRadius: String, googleMapView: GMSMapView) -> GMSMapView<br />
{<br />
return GMSMapView<br />
}<br />
usage of the above method is:<br />
`gMap = mapObject.initLocationManagerWithRadiusAndMap(getRadius: "yourradiusvalue", googleMapView: gMap)`<br />
(in viewDidLoad or wherever based on your preference)

3.mapManagers class has following variables:<br />
/// This variable is used to store all user informatiom from json/api<br />
public var userInformation: [[String: String]] = []<br />
/// This variable is used set custom marker image<br />
public var pinImage = UIImage()<br />
/// This variable is used for placeholder image inside the pin image <br />
public var userPlaceholderImage = UIImage()
/// This variable is used to store the current location of the user
 public var  currentLocationCoordinates = CLLocationCoordinate2D()

usage of the above variables is:<br />
`mapObject.userInformation = "yourData from api/json"`<br />
`mapObject.pinImage = UIImage(named: "yourImage")!`<br />
`mapObject.userPlaceholderImage = UIImage(named: "yourImage")!`

4.The following methods to get users and marker within the radius<br />
/// This method is to get all users within the radius<br />
/// - Returns: value in [[String: String]]<br />
public func getAllVisibleUserFromRadius() -> [[String: String]] <br />
{<br />
return [[String: String]]<br />
}<br />

/// This method is to get all markers within the radius<br />
/// - Returns: GMSMarker<br />
public func getAllVisibleMarkerFromRadius() -> [GMSMarker]<br />
{<br />
return  [GMSMarker]<br />
}

Note:<br />
gMap - outlet of your GMSMapView[used in your project]<br />
mapObject - instance of mapManagers class
